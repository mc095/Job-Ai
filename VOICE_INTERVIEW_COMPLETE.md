## 🎮 How It Works

### User Journey:
1. **Start** → User enters job role and settings
2. **Listen** → AI interviewer asks question via voice
3. **Record** → User clicks mic and speaks answer
4. **Transcribe** → Moonshine STT converts to text
5. **AI Process** → Gemini generates next question
6. **Speak** → Kokoro TTS converts to audio
7. **Repeat** → Continue for 5-15 questions
8. **Feedback** → Get detailed performance analysis

### Technical Flow:
```
Browser Audio → MediaRecorder API
      ↓
   WAV Blob → Django Backend
      ↓
Moonshine STT → Text Transcription
      ↓
 Gemini AI → Next Question Text
      ↓
 Kokoro TTS → Audio WAV
      ↓
   Browser → Audio Playback
```

});
const { session_id } = await response.json();

// 2. Record audio
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
const recorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
// ... record audio ...

// 3. Submit response
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('audio', audioBlob);
